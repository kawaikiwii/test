            <p> A tiger mauled to death an illegal logger on the Indonesian island of Sumatra, an official said Wednesday, the ninth such death in the last five weeks.</p>
            <p>The man, killed on Tuesday night in Jambi province, is the latest victim in a string of attacks that also claimed the lives of two illegal loggers on Sunday, provincial conservation agency head Didi Wuryanto told AFP.</p>
            <p>"The village head told me that a group of illegal loggers wanted to secretly transport the victim's body out of the forest. They didn't want to be caught breaking the law," Wuryanto said. </p>
            <p>Villagers have trapped and killed four of the endangered tigers in response to the string of deadly attacks, which conservationists say are largely caused by illegal logging in tiger habitats.</p>
            <p>Human-animal conflicts are a rising problem as people encroach on wildlife habitats in Indonesia, an archipelago nation with some of the world's largest remaining tropical forests.</p>
            <p>An 83-year-old man was also trampled to death on Wednesday by a herd of around 30 elephants that stormed into a village in neighbouring Riau province, the local conservation agency said.</p>
            <p>Wuryanto said provincial authorities met Wednesday to discuss preventive measures aimed at defending villagers and protecting the big cats from human reprisals. </p>
            <p>"We won't discuss how to stop tigers from wandering the forests, because that's their habitat, but we need to find immediate solution to avoid more victims," he said. </p>
            <p>There are less than 400 Sumatran tigers left in the wild, according to WWF.</p>
