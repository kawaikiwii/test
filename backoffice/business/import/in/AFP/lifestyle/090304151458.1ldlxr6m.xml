            <p> France's first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy wants to have a baby with her husband President Nicolas Sarkozy but would be just as happy to adopt one, she said in an interview to be published this week.</p>
            <p>"I would like that, but I don't know if at my age it would be possible," the 41-year-old singer and former supermodel told Figaro Magazine when asked if she hoped for a second child.</p>
            <p>"If it's not biologically possible, I'll adopt one," she added.</p>
            <p>In 2001, Bruni-Sarkozy had a son with her then lover, philosopher Raphael Enthoven. She married the French leader, who has three sons from two previous marriages, in February last year.</p>
            <p>"I'm not obsessed by blood ties," she told Le Figaro, explaining her attitude to adoption. "I think you can build a powerful bond without that.</p>
            <p>"So I'd love to have a child, but I'm not going to fight against nature, and at the same time, as I already have one, and my husband has three, you can't really say we have a need of children," she said.</p>
            <p>The interview, which Le Figaro carried out with Bruni-Sarkozy during her trip last week to West Africa to promote projects to battle AIDS, is to be published on Saturday.</p>
