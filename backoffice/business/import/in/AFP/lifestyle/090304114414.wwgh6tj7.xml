            <p> Nigeria's oil minister and former OPEC chief has been fined 4,000 naira (27 dollars, 21.5 euros) for ignoring a summons to appear before a special Senate panel, a local daily said on Wednesday.</p>
            <p>Rilwanu Lukman, 70, was last month asked to address a Senate committee on the oil sector reforms, but failed to do so.</p>
            <p>Senator Lee Maeba said had it not been for his age and status, the Senate would have raised a warrant of arrest against the minister, according to The Guardian.</p>
            <p>The fine, imposed on Tuesday, represents the cost of conveying the summons to the minister.</p>
            <p>"I did not neglect or refuse to attend the meeting... as I have made excuses," the former secretary general of the international oil cartel, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was quoted as saying.</p>
            <p>It was the first time since Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999 that a senior government official would be so sanctioned.</p>
